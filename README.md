Germs is a 2D interactive game coded in javascript. The purpose of the game is too absorb smaller particles by coming in contact and avoid being absorbed by larger particles. The game ends either when the player has absorbed all other entities on the screen or the player is absorbed. Each time the  player increases his/her movement speed, particles are ejected, thus making him/her smaller.
